1. How do I set up my .bash and .bashprofile?

   From Bash info file: 6. Bash features, bash startup files

   "So, typically, your `~/.bash_profile' contains the line
     `if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi'
   after (or before) any login-specific initializations."

2. How do I term off bell?
setterm -blength 0 in /etc/inputrc
or
set bell-style none in /etc/inputrc
